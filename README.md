# OpenSim-body
The following project has been constructed under the domain of Biomechanics.
The main motiv behind this project is to provide users and researchers, an opensource
file for editing the eopensim body data based on their needs. The files in the repository
is the exact representation of the human body and can be used for the utilisation of the
generation of any forms of model. Check the intructions for more insights!

# Instructions:
There is just a simple instruction for the usage of the file. Just out the MATLAB (.m file)
in the directory of the geometry folder of the OpenSim installation folder. From there, the
file wouldbe able to access all the data models and hence would be able to recall the information
about the models, internal or external
